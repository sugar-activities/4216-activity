  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Added a man page for usb-creator.8.
  * UI reworking after discussions with mpt.  Thanks Matthew.
    - The labels are far less wordy.
    - Enabling persistence is now an explict option button selection rather
      than implicitly enabled when the slider is moved to a value greater
      than 0.
    - There are now two treeviews, instead of the previous comboboxes, that
      update automatically to reflect changes to the device's structure, and
      provide warnings when a device is either unusable or require the user
      to delete some files to free up space before continuing.
  * Fixed the left-alignment of labels thanks to a tip from Colin Watson.
  * Merged the separate CD and ISO lists into the CD list in the backend.

    (LP: #269044).

    wired up the persistence scale in the frontend.
  * The backend now reports the task description in addition to the progress
    value.

    (LP: #269035).

    file for the option labels in the root of the device.

  * Automatically mount (and unmount) partitions (LP: #269032).
  * Fixed missing Debian dependencies (LP: #269767).
